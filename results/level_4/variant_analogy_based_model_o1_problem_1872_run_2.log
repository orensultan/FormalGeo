You output the following premises: Polygon(AEB)&Polygon(CED)&Equal(LengthOfLine(AE),LengthOfLine(CE))&Equal(LengthOfLine(EB),LengthOfLine(ED))&Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal(1,AEB,CED)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(EAB),MeasureOfAngle(DCE))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BAE),MeasureOfAngle(DCE))

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABDC)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(BD))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))

Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
23/4
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABDC); Parallelogram(ABDC); ["Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(BD))"]
