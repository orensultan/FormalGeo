Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_angle_equal> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: parallelogram_property_opposite_angle_equal(A,B,D,C)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: parallelogram_property_opposite_angle_equal(1,A,B,D,C)

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: value determination
- Model answer: 65/4
- Verifier expected answer: 8
- Error: THE MODEL DETERMINED THE ANSWER TO BE 65/4 BUT IN THE GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM THE ANSWER IS 8.
  Please review your theorem sequence and ensure it correctly establishes the expected answer.

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: value of y
- Model answer: 8
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AC ∥ BD
  Collinear Points: AED, BEC
  Polygons: ABC, ABD, ABDC, ABDCE, ABDEC, ABE, ABEDC, ACB, ACD, ACE, ADB, ADC, AEB, AEBDC, AEC, BCD, BDC, BDCA, BDCAE, BDCEA, BDE, BDECA, BED, BEDCA, CABD, CABDE, CABED, CAEBD, CDE, CEABD, CED, DCAB, DCABE, DCAEB, DCEAB, DECAB, EABDC, EBDCA, ECABD, EDCAB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Variable y is not uniquely determined
Please fix the proof.
