Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABDC)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(BD))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))

- Goal: value of y
- Model answer: 8
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AC ∥ BD
  Collinear Points: AED, BEC
  Polygons: ABC, ABD, ABDC, ABDCE, ABDEC, ABE, ABEDC, ACB, ACD, ACE, ADB, ADC, AEB, AEBDC, AEC, BCD, BDC, BDCA, BDCAE, BDCEA, BDE, BDECA, BED, BEDCA, CABD, CABDE, CABED, CAEBD, CDE, CEABD, CED, DCAB, DCABE, DCAEB, DCEAB, DECAB, EABDC, EBDCA, ECABD, EDCAB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Variable y is not uniquely determined
Please fix the proof.
