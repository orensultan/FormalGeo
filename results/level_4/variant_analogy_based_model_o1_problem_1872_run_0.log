You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(BD))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))

- Goal: value of y
- Model answer: 8
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AC ∥ BD
  Collinear Points: AED, BEC
  Polygons: ABC, ABD, ABDC, ABDCE, ABDEC, ABE, ABEDC, ACB, ACD, ACE, ADB, ADC, AEB, AEBDC, AEC, BCD, BDC, BDCA, BDCAE, BDCEA, BDE, BDECA, BED, BEDCA, CABD, CABDE, CABED, CAEBD, CDE, CEABD, CED, DCAB, DCABE, DCAEB, DCEAB, DECAB, EABDC, EBDCA, ECABD, EDCAB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Variable y is not uniquely determined
Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <> not defined in current GDL. Please rewrite the proof sequence, you are allowed to use only theorems from the GDL.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
NoUniqueSolution
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABDC); Parallelogram(ABDC); ["Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))"]

Explanation:
From the given data and theorems in the GDL, we can show that in parallelogram ABDC, BA and DC are equal in length. However, there are no additional GDL theorems or given constraints that link the angles involving y in a way that yields a unique solution. Consequently, the value of y remains indeterminate under the provided information and allowed theorems.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <> not defined in current GDL. Please rewrite the proof sequence, you are allowed to use only theorems from the GDL.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
NoUniqueSolution
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABDC); Parallelogram(ABDC); ["Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(DC))"]

Explanation:
Based on the GDL and the given data, we can establish that in parallelogram ABDC, BA = DC. However, there is no additional theorem or information in the GDL that relates the angles involving y in a way that would yield a single numeric value for y. Consequently, from the provided data and available GDL theorems alone, the value of y cannot be uniquely determined.
