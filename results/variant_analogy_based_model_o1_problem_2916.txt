#retry: 1; message: verification failed. Your task was to find the measure of angle ECD but this measure is still underconstrained. Specifically, you found that the measure of angle BCD is equal to the measure of angle CBA, but the measure of CBA, but you did not find the measure of CBA. Please fix the proof. You should modify only the THEOREM_SEQUENCE.
