Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <line_addition> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <line_addition> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument
