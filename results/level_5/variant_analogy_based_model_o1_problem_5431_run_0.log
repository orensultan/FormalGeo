- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.
