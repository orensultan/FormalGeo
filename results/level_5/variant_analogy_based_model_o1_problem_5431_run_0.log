- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BD| = |BO| + |DO|
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

Explanation of Key New Steps (7) and (8):
• After step 4 shows that O is the midpoint of AC, we know CO is simply half of CA. From triangle BCA being right-angled (step 2 and step 3), we deduce that line BC is perpendicular to line CA. Because O lies on AC (Collinear(AOC)), the angle at C in triangle BCO remains 90°.  
• Therefore, in step 7 we declare triangle BCO to be a right triangle at C.  
• Finally, in step 8, applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle BCO gives OB = √(BC² + CO²) = √(6² + 4²) = 2√13.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BD| = |BO| + |DO|
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed. Theorem  not defined in current GDL. Please rewrite the proof sequence, you are allowed to use only theorems from the GDL.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
No valid proof from the given GDL
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
No solution with current GDL.

Explanation:
Because the GDL does not provide any theorem that directly or indirectly computes the diagonal BD (and hence OB = BD/2) from the given parallelogram and right-angle constraints, there is no way to conclude a unique numerical value for OB using only the stated GDL theorems. The known side lengths (AB = 10, AD = 6, BC = 6) and the right angle at C (angle BCA = 90) uniquely determine OB in Euclidean geometry (by the well-known “parallelogram law” or by coordinate methods), but that law/method is not contained in the GDL. Therefore, there is no valid proof sequence solely from the GDL that constrains OB to 2√13.
