Failure: Theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(A,B,C,D)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,A,B,C,D)

You output the following premises: Parallelogram(BCDA)&Collinear(BOD)&Collinear(AOC)
But the correct premises: Parallelogram(BCDA)&Collinear(BOD)&Collinear(COA)

verification failed.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 2âˆš13
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BD| = |BO| + |DO|
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.
