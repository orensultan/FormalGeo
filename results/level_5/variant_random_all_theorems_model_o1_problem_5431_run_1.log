Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <right_triangle_judgment_angle> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: right_triangle_judgment_angle(A,B,C)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: right_triangle_judgment_angle(1,A,B,C)

verification failed.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 2*sqrt(13)
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

RETRY_ANSWER:
2*sqrt(13)
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; right_triangle_judgment_angle(1,BCA); Polygon(BCA)&Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BCA),90); ["RightTriangle(BCA)"]
2; right_triangle_property_pythagorean(1,BCA); RightTriangle(BCA); ["Equal(Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(BC),2),Pow(LengthOfLine(CA),2)),Pow(LengthOfLine(BA),2))"]
3; parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1,ABCD,O); Parallelogram(ABCD)&Collinear(AOC)&Collinear(BOD); ["IsMidpointOfLine(O,AC)"]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
No further theorems in the given GDL can uniquely derive OB = 2*sqrt(13). 
The standard approach relies on an additional parallelogram law (AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²)) 
or equivalent geometric/coordinate reasoning, which is not present in the GDL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
With the currently available GDL theorems, there is no direct way to complete a rigorous derivation of OB = 2√13 strictly from these premises. The standard “parallelogram law” (AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²)) or a similar argument is not present in the GDL, hence we cannot formally conclude |OB| = 2√13 from these theorems alone.
