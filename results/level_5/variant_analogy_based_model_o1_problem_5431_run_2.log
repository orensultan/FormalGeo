Failure: Theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument

Theorem: parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1,DABC,O)
You output the following premises: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(BOD)&Collinear(AOC)
But the correct premises: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(DOB)&Collinear(AOC)
You output the following conclusions: IsMidpointOfLine(O,BD)
But the correct conclusions: IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 5 - parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1, DABC, O): IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| > 0
  |DO| = |BO|

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: line_addition(1,BO,OD)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(DB),Add(LengthOfLine(BO),LengthOfLine(OD)))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BD),Add(LengthOfLine(BO),LengthOfLine(OD)))

/* Explanation Sketch:

- Step 1 identifies BC = AD = 6.  
- Steps 2â€“3 use the right triangle BCA to conclude CA = 8.  
- Steps 4â€“5 show O is midpoint of AC, so AO = OC = 4.  
- Steps 6â€“7 show O is midpoint of DB, so BO = OD and BD = 2Â·BO.  

From geometry (not directly in GDL), one can deduce BD = 4âˆš13. Hence BO = BD/2 = 2âˆš13. */
