Theorem: parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1,DABC,O)
The language model outputs the following premises: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(BOD)&Collinear(AOC)
The correct premises for the theorem: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(DOB)&Collinear(AOC)
The language model outputs the following conclusions: IsMidpointOfLine(O,BD)
The correct conclusions for the theorem: IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 5 - parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1, DABC, O): IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BD| = |BO| + |DO|
  |BO| > 0
  |DO| = |BO|

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed.
Theorem: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,ABCD)
The language model outputs the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BC),LengthOfLine(AD))
The correct conclusions for the theorem: Equal(LengthOfLine(BA),LengthOfLine(CD))
