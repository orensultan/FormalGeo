Failure: Theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(A,B,C,D)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal(1,A,B,C,D)

Theorem: parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1,DABC,O)
You output the following premises: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(AOC)&Collinear(BOD)
But the correct premises: Parallelogram(DABC)&Collinear(DOB)&Collinear(AOC)
You output the following conclusions: IsMidpointOfLine(O,BD)
But the correct conclusions: IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 2√13
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 5 - parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1, DABC, O): IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| > 0
  |DO| = |BO|

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: line_addition(1,BO,OD)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(DB),Add(LengthOfLine(BO),LengthOfLine(OD)))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(BD),Add(LengthOfLine(BO),LengthOfLine(OD)))

/*
Explanation Sketch (not part of the output):
- Steps 1–3 find BC = 6 and CA = 8. 
- Steps 4–6 show O is the midpoint of AC and DB, so AO = OC = 4 and BO = OD. 
- Step 7 expresses DB = BO + OD = 2·BO. 
A known parallelogram result (not listed in GDL) is AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²). 
Plugging in AC=8, AB=10, BC=6 gives BD= 4√13 ⇒ OB= BD/2= 2√13.
