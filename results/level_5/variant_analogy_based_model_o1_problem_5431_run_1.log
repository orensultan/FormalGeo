Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed. Theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <parallelogram_property_opposite_line_equal> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed. Theorem  not defined in current GDL. Please rewrite the proof sequence, you are allowed to use only theorems from the GDL.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
2âˆš13
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
No valid sequence of GDL theorems can derive OB = 2âˆš13 from the given data. 
(Reason: The GDL does not contain a diagonal-length formula or equivalent theorem that would yield BDâ€”and thus OBâ€”uniquely under these conditions.)
