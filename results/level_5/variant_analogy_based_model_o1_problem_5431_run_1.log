- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB âˆ¥ CD, AD âˆ¥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 5 - parallelogram_property_diagonal_bisection(1, DABC, O): IsMidpointOfLine(O,DB)
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BD| = |BO| + |DO|
  |BO| > 0
  |DO| = |BO|

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: right_triangle_judgment_angle(1,BOC)
You output the following premises: Polygon(BOC)&Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BCO),90)
But the correct premises: Polygon(BOC)&Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BOC),90)
