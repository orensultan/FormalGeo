You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(DA),LengthOfLine(BC))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AD),LengthOfLine(BC))

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: length of line OB
- Model answer: 7.211102550927978
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AB ∥ CD, AD ∥ BC
  Collinear Points: AOC, BOD
  Right Triangles: ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCD, ABCDO, ABCOD, ABD, ABO, ABOCD, ACB, ACD, ADB, ADC, ADO, AOB, AOBCD, AOD, BCD, BCDA, BCDAO, BCDOA, BCO, BCODA, BDC, BOC, BOCDA, CDAB, CDABO, CDAOB, CDO, CDOAB, COD, CODAB, DABC, DABCO, DABOC, DAOBC, DOABC, OABCD, OBCDA, OCDAB, ODABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BO| = |DO|
  |BO| > 0

Please fix the proof.

Failure: Theorem <> not defined in current GDL. Please rewrite the proof sequence, you are allowed to use only theorems from the GDL.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
2√13
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
(Unable to complete a fully constraining proof with the given GDL. No available theorem directly provides BD in order to determine OB, and the “parallelogram law” for the sum of squares of diagonals is not in the GDL. Consequently, there is no way to finish determining OB purely from the listed theorems.)
