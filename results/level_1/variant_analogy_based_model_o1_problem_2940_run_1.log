MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER2_PREMISE_VIOLATION
verification failed.

- Error: You tried to use theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_line_equal(1,BAD,ACB);MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle(BAD,ACB);['Equal(LengthOfLine(AD),LengthOfLine(CB))']
Missing premise: Triangles BAD and ACB not proven mirror congruent
Details: Required for mirror_congruent_triangle_property_line_equal
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: AEC, BED
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: ABD mirror congruent to ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCED, ABD, ABE, ACB, ADB, ADE, AEB, AED, BCE, BCEDA, BEC, CEDAB, DABCE, EDABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Please fix the proof.
