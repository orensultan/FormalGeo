MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: length of line BC
- Model answer: 5
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: AEC, BED
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: ABD mirror congruent to ABC
  Polygons: ABC, ABCED, ABD, ABE, ACB, ADB, ADE, AEB, AED, BCE, BCEDA, BEC, CEDAB, DABCE, EDABC
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  |BC| > 0

Please fix the proof.
