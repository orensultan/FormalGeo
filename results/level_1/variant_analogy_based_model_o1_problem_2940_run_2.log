MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_line_equal(1,DAB,CAB)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AD),LengthOfLine(BC))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(LengthOfLine(AB),LengthOfLine(AB))
