Theorem: parallel_property_alternate_interior_angle(2,WX,YZ)
You output the following premises: ParallelBetweenLine(WX,YZ)&Line(XZ)
But the correct premises: ParallelBetweenLine(WX,YZ)&Line(XY)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(ZXA),MeasureOfAngle(YXW))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(YXW),MeasureOfAngle(XYZ))

- Goal: measure of angle ZXA
- Model answer: 30
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: WX ∥ YZ, WY ∥ XZ
  Perpendicular Lines: WX ⊥ WY, WX ⊥ XZ, WY ⊥ YZ, XZ ⊥ YZ
  Collinear Points: WAZ, XAY
  Rectangles: WYZX, XWYZ, YZXW, ZXWY
  Polygons: AWX, AWY, AWYZX, AXW, AXWYZ, AXZ, AYW, AYZ, AYZXW, AZX, AZXWY, AZY, WAYZX, WXY, WXZ, WYAZX, WYX, WYZ, WYZAX, WYZX, WYZXA, WZX, WZY, XAWYZ, XWAYZ, XWYAZ, XWYZ, XWYZA, XYZ, XZY, YAZXW, YZAXW, YZXAW, YZXW, YZXWA, ZAXWY, ZXAWY, ZXWAY, ZXWY, ZXWYA
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  ∠AXZ <= 180
  ∠AXZ = ∠YXZ
  ∠AXZ > 0

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
The final answer should be a numeric answer, you gave an expression with algebraic variable. Please fix your proof.
Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
No valid proof can be constructed from the given GDL that concludes MeasureOfAngle(ZXA) = 30 under these problem conditions.
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; rectangle_property_diagonal_equal(1,WYZX); Rectangle(WYZX)&Line(WZ)&Line(YX); ["Equal(LengthOfLine(WZ),LengthOfLine(YX))"]
