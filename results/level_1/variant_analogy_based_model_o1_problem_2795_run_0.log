Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <angle_addition> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: angle_addition(A,B,C,C,B,D)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: angle_addition(1,A,B,C,C,B,D)

Theorem: angle_addition(1,YXZ,ZXA)
You output the following premises: Angle(YXZ)&Angle(ZXA)&Angle(YAX)
But the correct premises: Angle(YXZ)&Angle(ZXA)&Angle(YXA)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(YAX),Add(MeasureOfAngle(YXZ),MeasureOfAngle(ZXA)))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(YXA),Add(MeasureOfAngle(YXZ),MeasureOfAngle(ZXA)))

- Goal: measure of angle ZXA
- Model answer: 60
- Error: Your proof contains contradictory constraints. Check for incorrect values in premises, improper theorem application, or conclusions that contradict earlier assertions.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: WX ∥ YZ, WY ∥ XZ
  Perpendicular Lines: WX ⊥ WY, WX ⊥ XZ, WY ⊥ YZ, XZ ⊥ YZ
  Collinear Points: WAZ, XAY
  Rectangles: WYZX, XWYZ, YZXW, ZXWY
  Polygons: AWX, AWY, AWYZX, AXW, AXWYZ, AXZ, AYW, AYZ, AYZXW, AZX, AZXWY, AZY, WAYZX, WXY, WXZ, WYAZX, WYX, WYZ, WYZAX, WYZX, WYZXA, WZX, WZY, XAWYZ, XWAYZ, XWYAZ, XWYZ, XWYZA, XYZ, XZY, YAZXW, YZAXW, YZXAW, YZXW, YZXWA, ZAXWY, ZXAWY, ZXWAY, ZXWY, ZXWYA
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 3 - angle_addition(1, YXZ, ZXA): Equal(MeasureOfAngle(YXA),Add(MeasureOfAngle(YXZ),MeasureOfAngle(ZXA)))
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  ∠AXY = ∠YXZ + ∠AXZ
  ∠AXZ <= 180
  ∠AXZ = ∠YXZ
  ∠AXZ > 0

Please fix the proof.

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER2_PREMISE_VIOLATION
verification failed.

- Error: You tried to use theorem: adjacent_complementary_angle(1,YXZ,ZXA);Collinear(YXA)&Angle(YXZ)&Angle(ZXA);['Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(YXZ),MeasureOfAngle(ZXA)),180)']
Missing premise: Points YXA are not proven collinear
Details: Known collinear facts: [['W', 'A', 'Z'], ['X', 'A', 'Y'], ['W', 'A', 'Z'], ['X', 'A', 'Y']]
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: WX ∥ YZ, WY ∥ XZ
  Perpendicular Lines: WX ⊥ WY, WX ⊥ XZ, WY ⊥ YZ, XZ ⊥ YZ
  Collinear Points: WAZ, XAY
  Rectangles: WYZX, XWYZ, YZXW, ZXWY
  Polygons: AWX, AWY, AWYZX, AXW, AXWYZ, AXZ, AYW, AYZ, AYZXW, AZX, AZXWY, AZY, WAYZX, WXY, WXZ, WYAZX, WYX, WYZ, WYZAX, WYZX, WYZXA, WZX, WZY, XAWYZ, XWAYZ, XWYAZ, XWYZ, XWYZA, XYZ, XZY, YAZXW, YZAXW, YZXAW, YZXW, YZXWA, ZAXWY, ZXAWY, ZXWAY, ZXWY, ZXWYA
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Please fix the proof.
