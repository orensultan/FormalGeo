GOAL_SYMBOL:
cos(pi*ma_cba/180)

ANSWER:
41/63

THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
(Unable to construct a valid proof using GDL alone)

Explanation:
Unfortunately, the GDL dictionary does not contain a version of the cosine theorem (or any other theorem) that directly involves cos(CBA). The only cosine theorem in the dictionary, cosine_theorem(ABC), gives a relation for cos(CAB) (the angle at A). There is no theorem for angle B or an angle‐transformation theorem allowing us to convert between cos(CAB) and cos(CBA). Therefore, it is not possible to derive cos(CBA) purely through the GDL. 

In ordinary geometry, one would apply the Law of Cosines at angle B:  
  CA² = AB² + BC² − 2·AB·BC·cos(CBA)  
Solving for cos(CBA) would yield 41/63. However, because GDL does not include such a variant of the theorem nor a trigonometric identity to shift from angle A to angle B, there is no sequence of GDL theorems that can achieve the goal.

Theorem: cosine_theorem(1,ACB)
The language model outputs the following conclusions: Equal(Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(CB),2),Mul(2,LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(AB),Cos(MeasureOfAngle(CBA)))),Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(AC),2),Pow(LengthOfLine(AB),2)))
The correct conclusions for the theorem: Equal(Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(CB),2),Mul(2,LengthOfLine(AC),LengthOfLine(AB),Cos(MeasureOfAngle(BAC)))),Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(AC),2),Pow(LengthOfLine(AB),2)))

- Goal: cosine of angle CBA
- Model answer: 0.6507936507936508
- Error: Your proof doesn't provide enough information to determine this value. You need to add theorems that specifically constrain cosine CBA.
- Available premises:
  Polygons: ABC, ACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  cos_CBA <= 1
  cos_CBA >= -1
  ∠ABC <= 180
  ∠ABC > 0

Please fix the proof.
