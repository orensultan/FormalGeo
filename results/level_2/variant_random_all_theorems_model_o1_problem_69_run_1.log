Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: measure of angle FDG
- Model answer: 25.0
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Perpendicular Lines: DG ⊥ EG
  Collinear Points: EGF
  Polygons: DEF, DEG, DFE, DFG, DGE, DGF
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 1 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, DGF): Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(DGF),MeasureOfAngle(GFD),MeasureOfAngle(FDG)),180)
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  ∠DGF + ∠DFG + ∠FDG = 180
  ∠FDG <= 180
  ∠FDG > 0

Please fix the proof.
