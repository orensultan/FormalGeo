Explanation:

Within the given GDL, we can only establish that ∠CBA = ∠BCD by the alternate-interior-angle theorem for lines AB and CD parallel, intersected by BC. However, the dictionary does not contain any theorem that directly relates collinearity(E,B,C) to ∠ECD = ∠BCD. In standard geometry, one would typically invoke a collinearity-based angle-equality result (showing E extends BC, so ∠ECD and ∠BCD coincide). But since it is not in the GDL, we cannot include it in this mechanical proof. Despite that gap, the geometry of the figure gives ∠ECD = 70 by extension.

┈ Explanation ┈

Unfortunately, the provided GDL dictionary does not contain a direct theorem that lets us conclude "∠BCD = ∠ECD" or "∠ABC = ∠ABE" purely from the collinearity of points B, C, and E. Those additional equalities require a collinearity ⇒ (angle) equivalence rule that is missing from the GDL. 

Within the existing GDL, the single step we can validly use is the alternate interior angle property (step 1 above), which yields ∠CBA = ∠BCD. However, to complete the logical chain to ∠ECD = 70 (using the fact that B and E lie on the same line through C) would require an additional collinearity-based angle-equality theorem not present in the GDL. Hence the proof must stop here under the given restrictions, even though geometry tells us that collinearity(B, C, E) implies ∠BCD = ∠ECD and thus ∠ECD = 70.
