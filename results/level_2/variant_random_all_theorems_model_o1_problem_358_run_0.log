Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: value of h
- Model answer: 4.242640687119286
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Perpendicular Lines: AC ⊥ BC
  Right Triangles: ACB
  Polygons: ABC, ACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 2 - right_triangle_judgment_angle(1, ACB): RightTriangle(ACB)
  Step 3 - right_triangle_property_pythagorean(1, ACB): Equal(Add(Pow(LengthOfLine(AC),2),Pow(LengthOfLine(CB),2)),Pow(LengthOfLine(AB),2))
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Variable h is not uniquely determined
Please fix the proof.
