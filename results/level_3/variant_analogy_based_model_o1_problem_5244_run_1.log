- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: CAD
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: BEF mirror congruent to AEB
  Polygons: ABC, ABE, ACB, ADE, ADEB, ADEFB, AEB, AEBC, AED, AEFB, AEFBC, BADE, BADEF, BAEF, BCAE, BCAEF, BCDE, BCDEF, BEF, BFE, CAEB, CAEFB, CDEB, CDEFB, DEBA, DEBC, DEFBA, DEFBC, EBAD, EBCA, EBCD, EFBA, EFBAD, EFBCA, EFBCD, FBADE, FBAE, FBCAE, FBCDE
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found
