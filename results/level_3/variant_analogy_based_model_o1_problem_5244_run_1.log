Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed. Theorem <mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Verification failed. Theorem <triangle_property_angle_sum> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <triangle_property_angle_sum> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument
