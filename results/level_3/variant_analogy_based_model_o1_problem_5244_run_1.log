Failure: Theorem <mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal> branch error. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None. Please rewrite your response, you should change only the call to theorem <mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal> by adding the branch number from the dict_keys as the first argument
