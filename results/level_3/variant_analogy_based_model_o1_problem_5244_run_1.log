MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal(1,EFB,EBA)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(EFB),MeasureOfAngle(EBA))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BEF),MeasureOfAngle(AEB))

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: sum_angle CAB+EAD
- Model answer: 58
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: CAD
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: BEF mirror congruent to AEB
  Polygons: ABC, ABE, ACB, ADE, ADEB, ADEFB, AEB, AEBC, AED, AEFB, AEFBC, BADE, BADEF, BAEF, BCAE, BCAEF, BCDE, BCDEF, BEF, BFE, CAEB, CAEFB, CDEB, CDEFB, DEBA, DEBC, DEFBA, DEFBC, EBAD, EBCA, EBCD, EFBA, EFBAD, EFBCA, EFBCD, FBADE, FBAE, FBCAE, FBCDE
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Angle 1: CAB
Angle 2: EAD
Please fix the proof.

MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: angle_addition(1,FBE,BEF)
You output the following premises: Angle(FBE)&Angle(BEF)&Angle(FEB)
But the correct premises: Angle(FEB)&Angle(BEF)&Angle(FEF)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(FEB),Add(MeasureOfAngle(FBE),MeasureOfAngle(BEF)))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(FEF),Add(MeasureOfAngle(FEB),MeasureOfAngle(BEF)))
