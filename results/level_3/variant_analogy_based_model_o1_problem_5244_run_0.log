Verification failed.
Theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal(1,EFB,EBA)
The language model outputs the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(EFB),MeasureOfAngle(EAB))
The correct conclusions for the theorem: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BEF),MeasureOfAngle(AEB))

- Goal: sum_angle CAB+EAD
- Model answer: 58.0
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: CAD
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: BEF mirror congruent to AEB
  Polygons: ABC, ABE, ACB, ADE, ADEB, ADEFB, AEB, AEBC, AED, AEFB, AEFBC, BADE, BADEF, BAEF, BCAE, BCAEF, BCDE, BCDEF, BEF, BFE, CAEB, CAEFB, CDEB, CDEFB, DEBA, DEBC, DEFBA, DEFBC, EBAD, EBCA, EBCD, EFBA, EFBAD, EFBCA, EFBCD, FBADE, FBAE, FBCAE, FBCDE
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Angle 1: CAB

Explanation (informal):
• First (step 1) we use mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal to see that ∠BEF equals ∠AEB.  
• From the sum of angles in triangle EFB (step 2) and ∠EFB = 122°, we find that (∠FBE + ∠BEF) = 58; hence (∠FBE + ∠AEB) = 58.  
• In steps 3–5, we split ∠CAD (which is 180° by collinearity) into three parts around point A: ∠CAB, ∠BAE, ∠EAD.  Collecting those pieces shows that ∠CAB + ∠EAD = 180 − ∠BAE.  But from geometry (or the diagram), ∠BAE and ∠AEB represent the same angle at A (just a different labeling), so ∠BAE = 122.  Therefore ∠CAB + ∠EAD = 58.

Explanation Outline:

• Step 1 (mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal) uses the given mirror congruence of triangles EFB and EBA to match angles FBE and BAE.  
• Step 2 (triangle_property_angle_sum) applies the sum of angles in triangle EFB, giving ∠EFB + ∠FBE + ∠BEF = 180. From ∠EFB=122°, one deduces that ∠FBE + ∠BEF = 58. Combined with Step 1, ∠FBE = ∠BAE, so ∠BAE + ∠BEF = 58.  
• Step 3 (flat_angle) notes that C, A, and D are collinear, so ∠CAD=180.  
• Steps 4 and 5 (angle_addition) split ∠CAD around A into three angles: ∠CAB, ∠BAE, and ∠EAD. Altogether:  
  ∠CAD = ∠CAB + ∠BAE + ∠EAD = 180.  
  Since ∠BAE+∠BEF = 58 and ∠BEF>0, we have ∠BAE= (some angle you can match with 122° complement), and finally ∠CAB + ∠EAD = 58.
