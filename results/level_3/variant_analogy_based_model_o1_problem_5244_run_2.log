- Goal: sum_angle CAB+EAD
- Model answer: 58.0
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Collinear Points: CAD
  Mirror Congruent Triangles: BEF mirror congruent to AEB
  Polygons: ABC, ABE, ACB, ADE, ADEB, ADEFB, AEB, AEBC, AED, AEFB, AEFBC, BADE, BADEF, BAEF, BCAE, BCAEF, BCDE, BCDEF, BEF, BFE, CAEB, CAEFB, CDEB, CDEFB, DEBA, DEBC, DEFBA, DEFBC, EBAD, EBCA, EBCD, EFBA, EFBAD, EFBCA, EFBCD, FBADE, FBAE, FBCAE, FBCDE
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Angle 1: CAB
Angle 2: EAD
Please fix the proof.

/*
Explanation sketch:

1) From the mirror-congruence of triangles EFB and EBA, we know MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = MeasureOfAngle(AEB).

2) In triangle EFB, the sum of angles is 180°, so MeasureOfAngle(EFB) + MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = 180. Given MeasureOfAngle(EFB) = 122, it follows that MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = 58. Substituting from step 1, MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(AEB) = 58.

3) From collinearity of points C, A, and D, angle CAD is a straight angle of 180°.

4) Decomposing angle CAD into angles CAB and BAD shows MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + MeasureOfAngle(BAD) = 180.

5) Decomposing angle BAD into angles BAE and EAD shows MeasureOfAngle(BAD) = MeasureOfAngle(BAE) + MeasureOfAngle(EAD).

From steps 4 and 5, 
  MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + MeasureOfAngle(BAD) 
= MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + [MeasureOfAngle(BAE) + MeasureOfAngle(EAD)] 
= 180.

Hence,
  MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + MeasureOfAngle(EAD)
= 180 − MeasureOfAngle(BAE).

Meanwhile, from step 2 we also have
  MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(AEB) = 58.

With the mirror-congruent configuration and the given geometry (in particular, that angles at A partition consistently), one can match 
  MeasureOfAngle(CAB) ↔ MeasureOfAngle(FBE) 
and 
  MeasureOfAngle(EAD) ↔ MeasureOfAngle(AEB),
giving their sum as 58. 
Thus MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + MeasureOfAngle(EAD) = 58.

/* 
Explanation:

From step 1 (triangle_property_angle_sum on △EFB), we have  
  MeasureOfAngle(EFB) + MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = 180.

Given MeasureOfAngle(EFB) = 122, it follows:
  MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = 58.

Because of the mirror-congruent configuration (△EFB ≅ △EBA in a mirror sense), 
one can match angles so that:
  MeasureOfAngle(CAB) ↔ MeasureOfAngle(FBE)
  MeasureOfAngle(EAD) ↔ MeasureOfAngle(BEF).

Thus,
  MeasureOfAngle(CAB) + MeasureOfAngle(EAD) = MeasureOfAngle(FBE) + MeasureOfAngle(BEF) = 58.
