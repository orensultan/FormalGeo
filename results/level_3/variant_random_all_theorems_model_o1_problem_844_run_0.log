Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: area of quadrilateral DACB
- Model answer: 38.97
- Verifier expected answer: 38.9711431702
- Error: From your proof, the verifier determines the quad_area of DACB to be 38.9711431702, not 38.97 as you stated in your solution. Check your theorem applications and your answer.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AC ∥ BD, AD ∥ BC
  Perpendicular Lines: AC ⊥ CD
  Polygons: ACBD, ACD, ADC, BCD, BDAC, BDC, CBDA, DACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  Step 1 - parallelogram_area_formula_sine(1, DACB): Equal(AreaOfQuadrilateral(DACB),Mul(LengthOfLine(DA),LengthOfLine(AC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(DAC))))
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  areaQuadr_DACB ==
|AD|*|AC|*4330127018922193/5000000000000000
  areaQuadr_DACB >= 0

Please fix the proof.
