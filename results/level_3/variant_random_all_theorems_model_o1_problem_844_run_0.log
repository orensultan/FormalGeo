Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: triangle_area_formula_sine(1,DAC)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(AreaOfTriangle(DAC),Mul(LengthOfLine(DA),LengthOfLine(AC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(DAC)),1/2))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(AreaOfTriangle(DAC),Mul(LengthOfLine(DA),LengthOfLine(DC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(CDA)),1/2))

Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER3_GOAL_NOT_REACHED
verification failed.

- Goal: area of quadrilateral DACB
- Model answer: 38.97114317029974
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Parallel Lines: AC ∥ BD, AD ∥ BC
  Perpendicular Lines: AC ⊥ CD
  Polygons: ACBD, ACD, ADC, BCD, BDAC, BDC, CBDA, DACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Please fix the proof.
