- Goal: value of x
- Model answer: 39.81
- Error: Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the value. You need to use additional theorems to constrain the value.
- Available premises:
  Perpendicular Lines: AC ⊥ BC
  Right Triangles: ACB
  Polygons: ABC, ACB
- Theorems related to the goal:
  None found that constrain this goal
- Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
  None found

Variable x is not uniquely determined
Please fix the proof.
