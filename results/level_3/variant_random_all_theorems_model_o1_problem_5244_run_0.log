MirrorCongruentBetweenTriangle
Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Theorem: mirror_congruent_triangle_property_angle_equal(1,EFB,EBA)
You output the following conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(EFB),MeasureOfAngle(EBA))
But the correct conclusions: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BEF),MeasureOfAngle(AEB))
