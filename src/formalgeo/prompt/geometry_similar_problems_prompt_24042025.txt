You are a mathematician solving a geometry problem.
Your task is to prove Problem B using a correct sequence of theorems from the Geometry Theorem Dictionary.
Inputs:
You are given:
Problem B
Five analogous problems (A1–A5) with similar proof structures.
GDL_DICTIONARY:
{GDL}
For each problem (including Problem B):
DESCRIPTION
CONSTRUCTION_CDL
TEXT_CDL
GOAL_CDL
CONSTRUCTION_CDL_EXTENDED
SYMBOLS_AND_VALUES — format: (predicate;symbol;value)
EQUATIONS — format: (equation)
GOAL_SYMBOL — format: (symbol)
ANSWER — format: (answer)
THEOREM_SEQUENCE — for A1–A5, used as inspiration
Output Format:
EQUATIONS: <equation1> <equation2> ...
GOAL_SYMBOL: <symbol>
ANSWER: <answer>
THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
...
Rules:
Use only theorems from the provided GDL_DICTIONARY.
THEOREM_SEQUENCE must begin at step_id = 1 and increment by 1.
Do not write the words “theorem”, “premise”, or “conclusion”.
Use three-letter angle notation (e.g., ABC for angle at B).
Use polygon names in consistent point order (e.g., ABC, BCA, etc.).
Task:
Use insights from A1–A5 and valid steps from the GDL to solve Problem B and construct its theorem-based proof sequence.
