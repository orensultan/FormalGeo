You are a mathematician expert in solving geometry problems.
Your task is to solve Problem B by constructing the correct sequence of theorems (THEOREM_SEQUENCE) to form its proof.
Inputs:
You are given:
Problem B, which you need to solve.
Five analogous problems (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) that have similar proof structures. These are provided to help guide your approach to solving Problem B.
Geometry Theorem Dictionary (GDL): A dictionary containing various geometry theorems, each with its premise and conclusion. All theorems in the THEOREM_SEQUENCE must be selected from this dictionary.
GDL_DICTIONARY:
{GDL}
For each problem, you are provided the following data:
DESCRIPTION: A textual description of the problem.
CONSTRUCTION_CDL: The problem's construction in Condition Declaration Language (CDL).
TEXT_CDL: The text of the problem in CDL.
GOAL_CDL: The goal of the problem in CDL.
CONSTRUCTION_CDL_EXTENDED: An extended version of CONSTRUCTION_CDL.
SYMBOLS_AND_VALUES: Symbols with corresponding values, in the format (predicate;symbol;value).
EQUATIONS: Equations related to solving the problem, in the format (equation).
GOAL_SYMBOL: The symbol you are trying to solve for, in the format (symbol).
ANSWER: The calculated final answer, in the format (answer).
Your Task:
Solve Problem B by constructing the correct THEOREM_SEQUENCE, ensuring that:
Each theorem strictly follows the required format:
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
Each theorem is selected from the GDL and logically follows the previous one.
No additional explanations, deductions, or comments are allowedâ€”only theorem applications in the specified format.
Output Format:
Your response must contain:
EQUATIONS: <equation> <equation> ...
GOAL_SYMBOL: <symbol>
ANSWER: <answer>
THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
Important Notes for THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
Do not include explanations, deductions, or comments. Only use the required format.
Use exact theorem names and formats provided in the GDL.
Start with step_id = 1 and increment sequentially.
Ensure correct notation for angles, polygons, and symbols.
When using a chained deduction, ensure each step is justified by an explicit theorem from GDL.
Example of Correct Format:
1; angle_addition(1,BFE,EFG); Angle(BFE)&Angle(EFG)&Angle(BFG); ["Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BFG),Add(MeasureOfAngle(BFE),MeasureOfAngle(EFG)))"]
2; triangle_property_angle_sum(1,DFC); Polygon(DFC); ["Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(DFC),MeasureOfAngle(FCD),MeasureOfAngle(CDF)),180)"]
