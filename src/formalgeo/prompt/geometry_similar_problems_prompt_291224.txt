You are a mathematician expert in solving geometry problems.
Your task is to solve Problem B by constructing the correct sequence of theorems (THEOREM_SEQUENCE) to form its proof.
Inputs:
You are given:
Problem B, which you need to solve.
Five analogous problems (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5) that have similar proof structures. These are provided to help guide your approach to solving Problem B.
Geometry Theorem Dictionary (GDL): A dictionary containing various geometry theorems, each with its premise and conclusion. All theorems in the THEOREM_SEQUENCE must be selected from this dictionary.
For each problem, you are provided the following data:
DESCRIPTION: A textual description of the problem.
CONSTRUCTION_CDL: The problem's construction in Condition Declaration Language (CDL).
TEXT_CDL: The text of the problem in CDL.
GOAL_CDL: The goal of the problem in CDL.
CONSTRUCTION_CDL_EXTENDED: An extended version of CONSTRUCTION_CDL.
SYMBOLS_AND_VALUES: Symbols with corresponding values, in the format (predicate;symbol;value).
EQUATIONS: Equations related to solving the problem, in the format (equation).
GOAL_SYMBOL: The symbol you are trying to solve for, in the format (symbol).
ANSWER: The calculated final answer, in the format (answer).
THEOREM_SEQUENCE: The sequence of theorems used in the proof, formatted as:
step_id <step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
step_id <step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
Your Task:
You need to solve Problem B by constructing the correct THEOREM_SEQUENCE, which should consist of theorems from the GDL. Ensure that each selected theorem logically follows the previous one and contributes to the goal of solving Problem B.
Output Format:
Your response must contain the following:
EQUATIONS: <equation> <equation> ...
GOAL_SYMBOL: <symbol>
ANSWER: <answer>
THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
<step_id>; <theorem>; <premise>; <conclusion>
Important Notes for the THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
Do not include the words "theorem", "premise", or "conclusion". Your sequence should only contain the step ID, theorem name, premise, and conclusion.
Use the exact theorem names and formats provided in the GDL.
Start with step_id = 1 and increment sequentially.
When referring to angles, use three letters (e.g., ABC for the angle at B). Be mindful of the order, as ABC is different from ACB.
For polygons, list all distinct points in clockwise or counterclockwise order. For example, a polygon with points FGE can also be referred to as GEF or EFG.
Example of Correct THEOREM_SEQUENCE Format:
1; angle_addition(1,BFE,EFG); Angle(BFE)&Angle(EFG)&Angle(BFG); ["Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BFG),Add(MeasureOfAngle(BFE),MeasureOfAngle(EFG)))"]
2; triangle_property_angle_sum(1,DFC); Polygon(DFC); ["Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(DFC),MeasureOfAngle(FCD),MeasureOfAngle(CDF)),180)"]
Reminder:
Ensure that the theorems you select come from the GDL, follow the correct format, and use the proper arguments (e.g., angle order and polygon points).
Also, pay attention to the specific variation of the theorem (e.g., 1 for the first variation, 2 for the second, etc.).
