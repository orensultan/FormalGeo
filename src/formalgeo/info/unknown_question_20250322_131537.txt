Variables related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
- x

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_AE == x

No theorems directly involving 'x' were found in your proof.

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The constraints in your proof imply a different value for x than expected.
Check that your theorem applications and premises correctly establish the expected value.
