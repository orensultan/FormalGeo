Analysis Report for unknown_question
============================================================

Goal: Length of arc BSU
Expected value: 22.0

Arc BSU is defined in the system.
Current measure of arc BSU: 114.0Â°

Circle B has a defined radius.
Radius of circle B: 0.0
Computed arc length: 0.0
This doesn't match expected value 22.0.

Theorems related to arc BSU in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - circle_property_circular_power_segment_and_segment_angle(1, RST, RUV, B):
  Conclusion: Equal(Sub(MeasureOfArc(BSU),MeasureOfArc(BVT)),Mul(MeasureOfAngle(SRU),2))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. arc_BSU >= 0
2. arc_BSU <= 360
3. arc_BSU - arc_BTV == 2*angle_SRU

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The geometric constraints in your proof don't allow the arc length of BSU to be 22.0.
This means your proof implies a different arc length than expected.

Check that:
1. Your arc measure and radius values are correctly specified
2. You've correctly identified the arc in question
3. There are no errors in your arc length calculations
